                        <p>
                          This experience refers to the Vodafone Tobi Hackathon. The main idea of this hackathon was design the app that helps disabled people. Our team came with the idea to design the app with the concentration of blind and half-blind people. This app has the frontend of Android and backend was designed by Python with the NLP methodology, at the backend, I designed the NLP which receiving the information from the user over the voice and doing the speech-to-text and then looking at the vocabulary dictionary that provided when it finds it does the text-to-speech and send it to the user. By this idea, our team won the first place.

                          This experience refers to Bosch mobility hackathon. This event was held at Milan and our team designed the idea for managing park slots at Milan by using GPS sensors and by this methodology we are able to track the cars as well as sending the information to police and firefighters and emergency. The frontend was done by Android and the backend was designed by Nodejs for the tracking system of cars as well as storing the information by the provided API at Database (Database was implemented by MongoDB)

                        I was the exchange master student from Polytechnic of Turin to RWTH University of Aachen. The topic of my master thesis was reducing the power consumption inside the datacenter which had two main phases:
                        Prediction and optimization. Phase one referred to the prediction of the behaviour of the consumed inside
                        this environment and it was done by using time-series forecasting and ARIMA (Autoregressive integrated
                        moving average), implemented by Python programming and I got 98% accuracy without overfitting. Phase two
                        was referred to reducing the overall consumed power, which implemented by python programming with the
                        help of Grubi solver and the final result was reducing the consumed power of 13KW.
